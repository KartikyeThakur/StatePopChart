     ```bash
     export VARIABLE_NAME='value'
     ```
   
   - **Command Prompt (Windows):**
     ```cmd
     set VARIABLE_NAME=value
     ```

   - **PyCharm:**
     In PyCharm, you can set environment variables directly in the run/debug configuration:
     - Go to `Run` -> `Edit Configurations...`
     - Select your Python configuration (e.g., Flask, Django)
     - In the `Configuration` tab, you can specify environment variables in the `Environment variables` field.

2. **Accessing Environment Variables in Python:**
   Use the `os` module to access environment variables in your Python code.

   ```python
   import os

   # Get a single environment variable
   secret_key = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')

   # Get all environment variables
   all_env_vars = os.environ
   ```

3. **Using Environment Variables in Projects:**
   - **Security:** Never hardcode sensitive information directly into your codebase (e.g., API keys, passwords).
   - **Portability:** Environment variables allow your application to be easily moved between different environments without code changes.
   - **Configuration Management:** Centralized management of configuration settings for different deployment stages (development, staging, production).

4. **Best Practices:**
   - Store environment variables securely and avoid committing them to version control (use `.env` files or configuration management tools).
   - Document required environment variables for your project in the README or deployment instructions.
   - Use default values or handle missing environment variables gracefully in your code to avoid runtime errors.

### Example Usage

```python
import os

# Fetch environment variables
db_url = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL', 'default_db_url')
api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')

# Example function using environment variables
def connect_to_database():
    db_connection = connect(db_url)
    return db_connection

# Example usage of environment variables
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(f'Database URL: {db_url}')
    print(f'API Key: {api_key}')
```

By following these practices, you can effectively manage and utilize environment variables in your Python projects, ensuring flexibility, security, and ease of configuration across different deployment environments.

## Running Tests

1. **Testing Framework**: Choose a testing framework suitable for Python, such as `unittest` or `pytest`. For simplicity, we'll outline using `unittest`.

2. **Organize Test Files**: Create a directory named `tests` or similar, and place your test files inside it. Each test file typically corresponds to a module or functionality in your project.

3. **Write Test Cases**: Develop test cases that cover critical aspects of your project's functionality, including data processing and visualization.

### Test Structure

Assume you have a `main.py` script that visualizes population data from an Excel file (`state_population.xlsx`). Here’s how you might structure your tests:

1. **Test Data Loading**: Ensure data loading from Excel works correctly.
   
   ```python
   import unittest
   import pandas as pd

   class TestDataLoading(unittest.TestCase):
       def test_excel_loading(self):
           df = pd.read_excel('path_to_your_excel_file/state_population.xlsx', skiprows=2)
           self.assertFalse(df.empty, 'DataFrame should not be empty')

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       unittest.main()
   ```

2. **Test Data Processing**: Verify that data processing functions correctly filter and manipulate data as expected.

   ```python
   class TestDataProcessing(unittest.TestCase):
       def setUp(self):
           # Initialize test data or load from a known source
           self.df = pd.DataFrame({
               'State/UT': ['Andhra Pradesh', 'Arunachal Pradesh'],
               'Total Population': [1000000, 500000],
               'Total Male Population': [520000, 250000],
               'Total Female Population': [480000, 250000]
           })

       def test_data_filtering(self):
           # Example: Test filtering function
           filtered_df = self.df[self.df['Total Population'] > 0]
           self.assertEqual(len(filtered_df), 2, 'Filtered DataFrame length should match')

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       unittest.main()
   ```

3. **Test Visualization**: Check that the visualization output matches expected results.

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import mplcursors

   class TestVisualization(unittest.TestCase):
       def setUp(self):
           # Initialize test data or load from a known source
           self.df = pd.DataFrame({
               'Year': ['1991', '2001', '2011', '2021'],
               'Total Population': [1000000, 1200000, 1500000, 1800000],
               'Total Male Population': [520000, 600000, 750000, 900000],
               'Total Female Population': [480000, 600000, 750000, 900000]
           })

       def test_visualization(self):
           fig, ax = plt.subplots()
           ax.bar(self.df['Year'], self.df['Total Population'], label='Total Population')
           ax.bar(self.df['Year'], self.df['Total Male Population'], label='Total Male Population')
           ax.bar(self.df['Year'], self.df['Total Female Population'], label='Total Female Population')
           ax.legend()
           plt.close(fig)  # Close figure to prevent displaying during tests

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       unittest.main()
   ```

4. **Run Tests**: Execute your test suite from the command line:

   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests
   ```

   This command discovers and runs all test cases in the `tests` directory.

### Additional Considerations

- **Mocking**: Use mocking techniques to isolate your tests from external dependencies, such as data loading from files or APIs.
  
- **Assertions**: Include relevant assertions (`assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, etc.) to validate expected outcomes.

- **Coverage**: Measure test coverage to ensure critical parts of your codebase are adequately tested.

By following these steps and structuring your tests effectively, you can ensure the reliability and correctness of your Python project that visualizes population data for Indian states. Adjust the test cases as per your project’s specific functionalities and requirements.
